# IP-Locator

Hello Everyone ðŸ˜Š,
I made an Android Application named as "IP Locator" that shows the details of the ip address entered. It supports both Ipv4 and Ipv6 ip addresses. I made this application by using the
following concepts:-
1. API call using Retrofit
2. MVVM Architecture
3. Google Maps API
4. Splash Screen

Here are the glimpse of the UI of the app:-

<h4>Splash Screen</h4>
<img src = "images/splash_screen.jpeg" hieght = 400 width = 200/>
<br><br>

<h4>Home Screen</h4>
<img src = "images/home_screen.jpeg" hieght = 400 width = 200/>
<br><br>

<h4>Details of the IP Address</h4>
<img src = "images/ip_details.jpeg" hieght = 400 width = 200/>
<br><br>

<h4>Location on Map</h4>
<img src = "images/location_on_map.jpeg" hieght = 400 width = 200/>
<br><br>
